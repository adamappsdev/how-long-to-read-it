        <b>Assuming an average 300 words per page, your total reading time will be {time} minutes.</b>
        <p>The #1 rule to lifelong reading is interpreting it as a regular form of practice. Setting some time aside to read every evening is akin to setting some time aside for moderate exercise in the morning.</p>
        <b>If you're consisent, you'll finish it in {result} days.</b>
        <p>People tend to overestimate how many books they can read in a month and underestimate how many books they can read in a year.</p>
        <b>If you keep it up, you can finish {365 / result} books of similar magnitude in a year.</b>
        <p>The key to consistent reading is not reading everything you find lying about, but rather being selective with the kind of literature you consume.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of millions of unique books in the world with several million being published every year. Given the magnitude, it is no surprise that worthwhile, well-written books are hard to come by while mediocre, poorly-written books are a dime a dozen. If you want to read more, you'll have to spend some time researching unread books as well as understanding and interpreting your own particular taste of literature. Amazon, Goodreads and other user-rich bibliographic websites are a good source for interpreting whether a particular book will be a drag or not. Old-fashioned skimming of a few pages may also be a particularly efficient way of evaluating the quality and value of the writing found within it. Understanding your own tastes, however, will take some more time as you can only uncover this particular quandary with enough attentive, regular reading.</p>
        <p>Given the parameters are correct and daily consistency is adhered to, make a commitment to finish a book of this scope within some {result}Â±2 days, then move on to the next one.</p>
        <p>Happy reading!</p>
